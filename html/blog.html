                There are some significant changes in the transition to CSS3. The following points the specific technical changes introduced.
1.	Multiple background
A background property that is introduced in css3 is the ability to add multiple background images on one line using the background attribute.
 
Inorder to make changes to the background images, adding background style attributes like position, fixed, repeat can come after each image before the comma.
2.	Selectors
Besides the old selectors in CSS2 three more attribute selectors are introduced.
Element [attribute^="value"] Selector
This selector applies the styles below it on elements with an attribute whose attributes start with value specified.
 
The example above sets the width of an image whose src attribute starts with moon to 100%.
Element [attribute$="value"] Selector
This selector applies the styles below it on elements with an attribute whose attributes ends with value specified.
 
The example above sets the width of an image whose src attribute starts with moon to 100%.
Element [attribute*="value"] Selector
This selector applies the styles below it on elements with an attribute whose attributes includes value specified.
 
The example above sets the width of an image whose src attribute includes the value “walk” in it.
3.pseudo-classes
The following pseudo-classes were added to css3.
:root
This selector allows to select the root element in our DOM hierarchy ("html"for webpages).since CSS can be used for xml and svg too, it doesn’t necessarily mean <html>.
:last-child
Using  :last-child the last child of a given selector can be modified. 
 
In the example given above last paragraph inside “article” classe will be italic.
4.Colors
Besides the old hexadecimal and rgb ways to add colors, CSS3 brings the following two ways that gives us more control over colors.
i.	RGBA
It is the same as rgb but accepts a third parameter to control the opacity of the color we have chosen. The fourth argument is between 1 and 0(where 0 is transparent and 1 is opaue).
ii.	Opacity
If we don’t want to use the rgba, the opacity option lets us control the opacity of the color after specifying it with rgb or hexadecimal notation.
iii.	HSL and HSLA
These are important In order to change the hue, saturation and lightness. The hsl function accepts three parameters as degree for the hue,percentage for saturation and lightness.
5. drop shadows

These styles add a dropping shadow to an image. The inputs are specifies as the box shadow property that control the color, width, height, blue and offset of the shadow.
	6. Text shadows
	Similar to the drop shadows for texts. These attribute accepts X and Y offsets from the element,      blur radius, and color.
	6. border radius
	Border radius lets us control the radius(roundedness) of corners. It can accepts one input that lets it to be used for every corner or accepts four inputs if we want to use different corner radiuses.

2. Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ?
Back then, when there were no differences between size of computers, using pixel-based styling in our css never raised an issue. But when computers started to come in different sizes, actual measured(pixel) stylings started to show different styles on different machines. These is one of the reasons why relative sizes should be used. The other important thing to consider is browser zooming.
Browzer zooming
When browser zooming is used, it scales up the whole content of the page in proportion. That means it won’t have much difference whether we used relative or fixed measurements. But here let’s consider the type of browser zooming that enables us to adjust preferred font size. Accommodating this feature is important if short sighted people are to view the site.
